# 3.4 - Semantic HTML

## Exercises

### Practice

The aim of these exercises is practising what you've learned about Semantic HTML.
To this end, we are going to create a page that introduces one of the most impressive animals that exists: the Stomatopoda. Styling is on your own ðŸ˜‰
For a better organization, make commits at each concluded task. Let's begin:

1. Add a header containing the title ```Soco a 80km/h: ConheÃ§a o Stomatopoda```
2. Add a group of links that represent the navigation area of the site
3. Create a link named ```PÃ¡gina Inicial```
4. Create a link named ```Sobre```
5. Create a link named ```Contato```
6. Create an article with interesting facts about Stomatopoda. It must contain a subheading ```Fatos sobre o Stomatopoda```.
7. Split the article into sections like the following order:
8. First section containing info about the animal. The subheading for this section is on your own. It is required for this section to have the Stomatopoda's scientific name which is ```Odontodactylus scyllarus``` in italics. Besides, table information about the scientific classification (Reino, Filo, Subfilo, Classe, Subclasse e Ordem) must be available.
9. Other sections describe some interesting facts of your choice about Stomatopoda. For each fact, a section must be created.
10. For each section, add a different subheading
11. Add paragraphs to each section describing the chosen fact. Highlight the stunning skills about the fact you've chosen, in order to boost the unicity of Stomatopoda. Example: If you create a section for the potent punch, it would be interesting to bold the speed of its punch.
12. Add, for each section, an image to illustrate the fact.
13. Add, at last, a section for bibliography, containing a list of links that were used to join all the information.
14. Add some content aside from the article, providing a link to a video that shows the animal in action.
15. Add a footer to the page, showing something like "Compile by 'You name'."

### Validating the exercises

Now that you've created the page, assume that a person with vision disability accesses your page. Would it be accessible for this person?
Let's check!
Use the aChecker site to validate if the semantics is correct.
