# 6.2 - JS Librarys and CSS Frameworks

## Exercises

1. Add a CSS framework of your choice to the form you created at the previous day and use it to style the form

2. Add a _date picker_ JavaScript library to the form you created at the previous day. Use it at the ``Beginning Date`` field of the form. You can remove the validations that you've added, once the library will be in charge of allowing only valid dates.

3. Add a validation JavaScript library to the form you created at the previous day. Use it to substitute the validations that you've made manually.
