# Exercises

## Deepen your knowledge

Read carefully the question titles and do what is asked!
> We recommend you to use the ``debugger`` during the exercises. In this way, it will be easier to follow the code behaviour and understand what is happening in each line.

1. Create a program that, given any value to ``n`` since ``n > 1``, prints on the screen a square made of stars which its size is the value of ``n``
```
n = 5

*****
*****
*****
*****
*****
```
2. Do the same as before, but print a triangle with 5 stars on its base.
```
n = 5

*
**
***
****
*****
```
3. Now reverse the triangle.
```
n = 5

    *
   **
  ***
 ****
*****
```
4. Then build a pyramid with a base sized of ``n`` stars
```
n = 5

  *
 ***
*****
```

## Bonus

5. Build a hollow pyramid with a base sized of ``n`` stars. Assume that ``n`` is always odd.
```
n = 7

   *
  * *
 *   *
*******
```
6. Create a program that says if some defined number is a prime or not.
